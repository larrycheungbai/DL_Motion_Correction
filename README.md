# DL_Motion_Correction
This repo is the official implementation of our paper "Motion correction in MRI using deep learning and a novel hybrid loss function".
The required packages for running the code have been listed in spec-file.txt.
We provide test.py for testing our trained model.
After install the required packages, you can just using the following command to run the code:

python test.py


## Dependency

Python
Keras
Tensorflow
